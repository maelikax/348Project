## Overview
<p>Welcome to our EECS348 project! We designed a user-friendly expression solver that can parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions. The user can run the program on their terminal and enter in any expression that adheres to the specified requirements. The expression solver will process the input and return the evaluation.</p>

## How To Run And Use It
- Download the ZIP file and locate the 'code' folder using your terminal
- Type the following in the terminal
  
  ```
  make clean
  make
  ./calculator
  ```
- Now you're able to use our solver! Enter in any expression that uses these operators: +, -, *, /, ^ or **, %, e
- You may also use parentheses () and brackets []
- If you're ready to exit, type 'quit' or use Ctrl+D
